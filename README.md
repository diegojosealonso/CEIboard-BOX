# Cat Shelter RSS Feed "CEIboard Box"

## Theme
The chosen theme is a **cat shelter**.  
The idea behind this project is to share regular entries related to the shelter—such as stories, updates, and care information—using a format that is different from a traditional “News” website :) Also we wanted to click on a carboard box to access the rss. Just because it looks cute.
